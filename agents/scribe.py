"""Scribe agent (LFM2.5-VL-1.6B). No tools -- consumes DBOS blackboard context only.

Standalone here per KICKOFF_CHECKLIST.md §6: build and validate each agent in
isolation before wiring into the DBOS pipeline (§7). The @DBOS.step() wrapper,
set_event/get_event blackboard reads, and prior-spec lookup from
`spec_versions` get added at §7 -- this module takes plain dicts so it can be
smoke-tested without a running DBOS workflow.
